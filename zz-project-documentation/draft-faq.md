# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions... Eventually)

The questions nobody's asked yet, but probably should. This is where I preemptively answer the things you're wondering about while browsing around, like why I thought I could make a game without any art skills, or how long my "quick weekend project" has been sitting unfinished. Consider this section part FAQ, part therapy session, and part warning label for anyone thinking about collaborating with me.
