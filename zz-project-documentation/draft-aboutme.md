# About

**TK ForgeWorks** is where problem-solving meets "let's see what happens if I try *this*." I'm a mechanical engineer by day, herding cross-functional teams to bring transit systems to life \- but this studio is where I escape corporate committees and actually get to break things on purpose. You'll find projects spanning hardware fixes, software experiments, and my slightly delusional belief that I can learn game development without any formal creative training.

The name comes from my initials and romanticizing the idea of a forge \- that mythical single-person workshop where raw materials become something useful through sheer stubbornness. Like a blacksmith who creates beautiful work while insisting they're "just hitting metal with a hammer," I'm drawn to building things that solve problems, even if I have to learn half the skills along the way.

This whole venture started because my day job, while rewarding, comes with the usual corporate constraints: customer requirements, regulatory approval, and meetings about meetings. Here, I get to ask "what if?" without having to justify ROI to anyone but myself.  
My projects reflect this blend of practicality and overambition. I've built modular kitchen organizers that finally tamed my cable chaos (and only took three iterations to get right). I'm currently deep in the trenches of **Aether Gears**, an action RPG about corporate greed and resource exploitation, which seemed like a reasonable first game project until I actually started making it. I'm also developing a *Magic: The Gathering* collection tracker using Java/Spring, because apparently I thought managing a card database was simpler than it actually is. The MVP works, but my grand vision of computer vision card recognition might be a few learning curves away.

While my background screams "hardware guy," I'm gravitating toward software and game development. Turns out, many engineering problem-solving skills translate surprisingly well to debugging code at 2 AM.

The journey matters as much as the destination here. I'm documenting the failures alongside the occasional wins, proving that you don't need natural creative talent \- just persistence and a high tolerance for starting over.

If you're into elegant solutions, questionable project scope, or have ideas that need someone willing to figure things out through trial and error, let's connect.
