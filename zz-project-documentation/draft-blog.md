# Blog/Updates

Welcome to my digital workshop notes, where I document the inevitable journey from "this will be easy" to "why did I think this would be easy?" You'll find project updates, technical discoveries, spectacular failures, and those rare moments when something actually works on the first try. Updates happen when they happenâ€”sometimes weekly, sometimes when I remember I have a website. Think of it less like a professional blog and more like a lab notebook that occasionally makes jokes about itself.
