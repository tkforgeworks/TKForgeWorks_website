Got an idea that's either brilliant or completely unhinged? Perfectâ€”those are my favorite kind. Whether you're looking to collaborate on something equally ambitious, need a second pair of eyes on a technical challenge, or just want to commiserate about why your code worked yesterday but not today, drop me a line. I promise to respond faster than I finish my personal projects, which admittedly isn't setting the bar very high. Fair warning: I might get overly excited about your problem and suggest seventeen different ways to solve it.
